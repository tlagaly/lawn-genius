# Development Auth Bypass Implementation

## Progress Made
1. Simplified auth configuration in auth-options.ts
2. Implemented development-only credentials provider
3. Removed middleware redirect logic
4. Updated LoginForm to handle auto-signin in development

## Current Status
- Rewrote auth-options.ts with clean configuration
- Need to test the development auth bypass
- Need to verify lawn profile creation flow

## Next Steps
1. Test development auth bypass:
   - Launch browser to /dashboard/lawn/new
   - Verify auto-signin with test account
   - Check redirect behavior
2. Test lawn profile creation:
   - Fill out profile form
   - Test SpeciesSelection integration
   - Verify data persistence
3. Add validation messages and error handling

## Suggested Task Prompt
