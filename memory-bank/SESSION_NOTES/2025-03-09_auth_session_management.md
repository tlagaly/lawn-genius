# Auth Session Management Implementation

Created: March 9, 2025 6:06 PM CST

## Overview

Implemented session management fixes from the auth system plan, focusing on:
1. NextAuth Configuration
2. Session Initialization
3. Session Persistence

## Implementation Details

### 1. Session Types and Validation

Created robust type system for session management:
- Added proper TypeScript types for sessions and users
- Implemented type guards for runtime validation
- Added assertion functions for type safety

Key files:
- src/lib/auth/types.ts

### 2. Storage Management

Implemented safe storage abstraction:
- Created type-safe storage API
- Added fallback mechanisms between session/local storage
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added validation for storage operations

Key files:
- src/lib/auth/storage.ts

### 3. Session Management

Enhanced session handling with:
- Proper type safety throughout
- Robust validation checks
- Clear error handling
- Session persistence with fallback storage
- Event handling for auth state changes

Key files:
- src/lib/auth/session.ts

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:
- Type guards for runtime validation
- Error handling for storage operations
- Validation for session data
- Proper cleanup on errors

## Next Steps

1. Update e2e tests to verify:
   - Session persistence
   - Storage fallback behavior
   - Error handling
   - Event handling

2. Add integration tests for:
   - Session initialization
   - Storage operations
   - Type validation

3. Update auth documentation with new session management details
