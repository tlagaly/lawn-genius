# Weather ML System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented machine learning capabilities for the weather system to improve treatment effectiveness predictions and scheduling optimization.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Model
- Added WeatherTrainingData model in Prisma schema
- Stores weather conditions, treatment type, and effectiveness
- Includes quality and confidence scoring
- Supports model validation metrics

### 2. ML Service
- Location: src/lib/weather/ml/service.ts
- Implements WeatherMLService class
- Provides prediction and training capabilities
- Features type-safe metric handling

### 3. Type System
- Enhanced WeatherData with index signatures
- Added isWeatherMetric type guard
- Implemented confidence scoring types
- Added ML-specific interfaces

## Features

### 1. Training Pipeline
- Automatic data collection from treatments
- Quality filtering for training data
- Configurable retraining intervals
- Model metrics tracking

### 2. Prediction System
- Weather condition analysis
- Treatment effectiveness scoring
- Individual metric confidence scoring
- Factor impact analysis

### 3. Quality Controls
- Data quality thresholds
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Metric-specific confidence adjustments
- Validation metrics tracking

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```typescript
const DEFAULT_CONFIG: MLConfig = {
  minDataPoints: 50,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.7,
  trainingInterval: 24, // hours
  featureWeights: {
    temperature: 1.0,
    humidity: 0.8,
    precipitation: 1.0,
    windSpeed: 0.6,
    cloudCover: 0.4,
    soilMoisture: 0.9
  }
};
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Adding Training Data
```typescript
await weatherMLService.addTrainingData({
  weatherConditions: currentWeather,
  treatmentType: 'Fertilization',
  effectiveness: 4
});
```

### 2. Getting Predictions
```typescript
const prediction = await weatherMLService.predictEffectiveness(
  weatherData,
  'Fertilization'
);
```

### 3. Checking Model Health
```typescript
const metrics = await weatherMLService.getModelMetrics();
```

## Next Steps

1. Testing
   - Load testing with simulated data
   - Accuracy validation
