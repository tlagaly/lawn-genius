This would include:
1. Setting up form state management
2. Adding input validation
3. Implementing error handling
4. Creating a mock API endpoint
5. Adding success/error notifications

To continue where we left off, use the prompt:
"Hi Roo! Let's continue working on the Lawn Genius app. We've completed the base structure and pages. Now let's implement form handling and validation for the Schedule and Contact forms to make them functional."
