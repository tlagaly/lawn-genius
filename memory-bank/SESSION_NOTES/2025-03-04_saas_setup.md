     * Lawn profile operations
     * Schedule and treatment handling
     * Subscription and payment processing
   - Added error handling and validation

4. Subscription System
   - Integrated Stripe for payment processing
   - Defined subscription tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
   - Implemented subscription management
   - Added payment history tracking

5. Directory Structure

   - Created separate directories for:
     * API routes
     * Components
     * Server-side logic
     * Type definitions
     * Utility functions

## Technical Notes

1. Authentication Flow
   - Using JWT strategy with NextAuth.js
   - Session management through database
   - Role-based access control implemented

2. Database Design
   - Normalized schema for efficient queries
   - Proper indexing for performance
   - Soft delete implementation for data retention

3. API Architecture
   - Type-safe endpoints with tRPC
   - Input validation using Zod
   - Error handling middleware
   - Rate limiting consideration

4. Subscription System
   - Stripe integration for payments
   - Webhook handling for subscription events
   - Automatic renewal process
   - Payment failure handling

## Considerations

1. Performance
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Consider implementing connection pooling

2. Security

   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting

3. Scalability
   - Database indexing strategy
   - Caching implementation
   - API optimization
   - Resource monitoring

4. User Experience
   - Responsive design
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Success feedback
