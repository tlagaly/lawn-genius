# Recurring Schedules Implementation Progress

## Current Status
- Created initial architecture and design in `2025-03-05_recurring_schedules.md`
- Updated Prisma schema with RecurrencePattern and RecurrenceException models
- Created new recurring-schedule router with basic functionality
- Implemented helper functions for handling recurrence patterns
- Fixed TypeScript type issues and completed router implementation
- Added proper error handling and weather integration

## Resolved Challenges
1. TypeScript type issues with Prisma:
   - Resolved type definitions using Prisma's type system
   - Implemented proper JSON field handling for weekdays array
   - Fixed include statements using type assertions
   - Added proper serialization/deserialization for recurrence patterns

2. Implementation Complexities:
   - Implemented all update modes (single, future, all)
   - Integrated weather optimization with recurring schedules
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Proper handling of recurring treatments

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Implementation:
   - Update ScheduleForm component to handle recurrence patterns
   - Add UI elements for recurrence configuration
   - Implement calendar view for recurring schedules
   - Add visual indicators for recurring events

2. Testing and Validation:
   - Add comprehensive tests for recurrence patterns
   - Validate weather integration
   - Test different update modes
   - Verify error handling

3. Documentation:
   - Document recurrence pattern configuration
   - Add usage examples
   - Document weather integration features

## Technical Notes
- Using type assertions with Prisma includes as a workaround for relation typing
- Implemented proper serialization for JSON fields
- Added helper functions for recurrence pattern handling
- Integrated with existing weather optimization system

## Suggested Prompt for Next Session
"Implement the frontend components for recurring schedules in the lawn care management system. We need to:
1. Update the ScheduleForm component to support recurrence patterns
2. Add UI elements for configuring recurring schedules
3. Implement calendar view with recurring event support
4. Add visual indicators and controls for managing recurring schedules
