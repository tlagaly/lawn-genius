# Auth Testing Progress

## Completed Work
1. Set up test database infrastructure
   - Created setup-test-db.ts script
   - Added database cleanup and initialization
   - Implemented transaction support

2. Improved test utilities
   - Enhanced test client with proper error handling
   - Added force cleanup functionality
   - Increased wait times between operations
   - Added better transaction support

3. Updated test files
   - Fixed OAuth test data handling
   - Updated session handling in protected routes
   - Improved test cleanup between runs
   - Added proper transaction support for database operations

4. Fixed OAuth Testing Issues
   - Implemented proper next-auth/react mocking
   - Added unique test profiles for session tests
   - Improved test data isolation
   - Enhanced cleanup between tests

5. Current test status
   - 33 passing tests (including fixed OAuth tests)
   - 1 failing test (protected routes)
   - Overall test coverage improving

## Remaining Work
1. Fix failing test:
   - Protected routes unique constraint violation
   - Apply lessons learned from OAuth fixes:
     * Use unique test data
     * Improve cleanup
     * Enhance mock implementations

2. Additional test coverage needed (prioritized):
   - Password reset flow (next priority)
   - Email verification
   - Account linking/unlinking
   - Session expiration
   - Rate limiting
   - Error boundaries

3. Infrastructure improvements:
   - Add test data factories (using patterns from OAuth fixes)
   - Standardize mock implementations across test suites
   - Add integration test suite
   - Add E2E test suite

## Next Steps
1. Fix protected routes test using OAuth test patterns:
   - Implement unique test data strategy
   - Add specific cleanup routines
   - Enhance mock implementations
2. Implement password reset flow tests:
   - Token generation/validation
   - Email sending mocks
   - Error scenarios
3. Add remaining auth flow test coverage
4. Implement E2E testing with Playwright

## Technical Decisions
1. Using transactions for test operations to ensure atomicity
2. Implementing force cleanup to prevent test interference
3. Using longer wait times between operations for stability
4. Separating test client configuration for better isolation
5. Standardizing mock setup at test file level
6. Using unique test data per test case
7. Implementing targeted cleanup routines

## Notes
- Mock setup should be done at the top level of test files
- Each test should use unique identifiers to prevent conflicts
- Cleanup should be specific to test data rather than global
- Consider extracting common test patterns into shared utilities
- Transaction approach working well but needs consistent usage
