# Auth Testing Fixes

## Implementation Details
1. Created test data factory pattern
   - Implemented TestFactory class with tracked cleanup
   - Added user, session, and OAuth account creation
   - Ensured unique identifiers for all test data

2. Fixed protected routes test issues
   - Removed role-based tests (not in schema)
   - Added proper cleanup between tests
   - Implemented unique session tokens
   - Added transaction support for concurrent tests

3. Technical Decisions
   - Using UUID for unique identifiers
   - Tracking created entities for cleanup
   - Using Promise.all for concurrent operations
   - Implementing proper TypeScript types

## Results
- Protected routes tests now properly isolated
- No more unique constraint violations
- Improved test reliability
- Better error handling
- Cleaner test setup/teardown

## Next Steps
1. Implement password reset flow tests:
   - Token generation/validation
   - Email sending mocks
   - Error scenarios

2. Add remaining auth flow tests:
   - Email verification
   - Account linking/unlinking
   - Session expiration
   - Rate limiting

## Notes
- Factory pattern working well for test isolation
- Consider extracting common test patterns into shared utilities
- Need to document test data creation patterns for team
