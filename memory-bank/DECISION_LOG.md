# Database Configuration and Connection Pooling Setup (2025-03-08)

## Context
As part of Phase 2 of the deployment environment plan, we needed to implement robust database configurations for different environments and set up connection pooling for improved performance and reliability.

## Decisions

### 1. Environment-Specific Database Configurations
- Implemented separate database configurations for development, staging, and production
- Added `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` for connection pooling support
- Introduced `DATABASE_RELATION_MODE` for environment-specific relation handling

### 2. Connection Pooling Implementation
- Configured connection pooling with the following parameters:
  - Minimum connections: 2 (ensures basic availability)
  - Maximum connections: 10 (prevents resource exhaustion)
  - Idle timeout: 60 seconds (balances resource usage)
  - Pool timeout: 30 seconds (prevents hanging connections)

### 3. SSL Configuration
- Added SSL configuration options for production security
- Made SSL configurable per environment
- Added SSL certificate verification controls

## Technical Implementation
1. Updated Prisma schema with connection pooling settings
2. Added environment variables for database configuration
3. Implemented pool size controls and timeout settings
4. Added SSL configuration options

## Rationale
- Connection pooling improves performance by reusing connections
- Environment-specific configurations enable proper isolation
- SSL settings ensure secure database connections in production
- Configurable pool sizes allow for environment-specific optimization

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Connection pool exhaustion
  - Mitigation: Configured maximum pool size and timeouts
- Risk: SSL certificate issues
  - Mitigation: Added certificate verification controls
- Risk: Environment configuration mistakes
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation in .env.example

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create environment-specific database instances
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Implement database monitoring
- [ ] Create database migration procedures

# Decision Log

## Deployment Environment Setup (2025-03-08)

### 1. Environment Configuration Strategy
**Decision**: Implement three distinct environments (development, staging, production)
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Isolated testing environments
- Predictable deployment pipeline
- Better security control

**Implementation Details**:
- Created comprehensive .env.example with detailed documentation
- Implemented .env.staging with test service configurations
- Implemented .env.production with enhanced security settings
- Updated .gitignore to properly manage env files
- Added feature flags and monitoring configurations

**Impact**:
- More robust testing capabilities
- Reduced production risks
- Better development experience
- Cleaner deployment process
- Improved security controls
- Better onboarding through documentation

### 2. Database Management
**Decision**: Separate databases per environment with environment-specific migrations
**Rationale**:
- Prevents cross-environment data contamination
- Enables isolated testing
- Supports different scaling needs
- Better security control

### 3. Authentication Configuration
**Decision**: Environment-specific auth settings with simplified development mode
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with existing development mode auth decision
- Maintains security in production
- Simplifies local development
- Supports testing scenarios

### 4. Service Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Use separate service accounts and API keys per environment
**Rationale**:
- Better usage tracking
- Isolated rate limits
- Enhanced security
- Easier debugging

## User Profile Management (2025-03-08)

### 1. Auth System Simplification
**Decision**: Remove role-based functionality from auth system
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies auth configuration
- Reduces complexity in token handling
- Improves development experience
- Can be added later if needed

**Impact**:
- Cleaner auth implementation
- Easier testing and maintenance
- More straightforward user management

### 2. Profile Component Structure
**Decision**: Split profile management into three components
- ProfileForm
- PrivacySettings
- ImageUpload

**Rationale**:
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code
- Easier testing
- Reusable components

### 3. Form Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Use Zod with React Hook Form
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe validation
- Consistent with existing patterns
- Good developer experience
- Runtime type checking

### 4. Privacy Settings Design
**Decision**: Implement granular privacy controls
**Rationale**:
- Gives users more control
- Follows best practices
- Flexible for future expansion
- Better user experience

### 5. Development Mode Auth
**Decision**: Implement simplified JWT handling in development
**Rationale**:
- Easier debugging
- Better development experience
- No impact on production security
- Faster iteration

## Previous Decisions

### Auth System Implementation (2025-03-07)
[Previous auth system decisions remain unchanged]

### Testing Strategy (2025-03-06)
[Previous testing decisions remain unchanged]

### Database Schema (2025-03-05)
[Previous schema decisions remain unchanged]

## Notes
- All decisions are subject to review as requirements evolve
- Focus on maintainability and developer experience
- Security considerations prioritized
- User experience emphasized
