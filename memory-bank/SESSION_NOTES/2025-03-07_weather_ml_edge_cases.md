# Weather ML System Edge Cases and Integration Testing

## Progress Made

### Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive mock types for testing:
  - MockTreatment
  - MockLawnProfile
  - MockSchedule
  - MockWeatherAlert
  - MockWeatherData
  - MockNotification

- Enhanced test setup with:
  - Proper Prisma client mocking
  - Type-safe mock implementations
  - Relationship handling between mock entities
  - Error handling in mock responses

### Edge Cases Covered
1. Data Validation
   - Required fields checking
   - Value range validation
   - Type checking for numeric fields
   - Handling of undefined optional fields

2. Data Quality
   - Quality scoring based on completeness
   - Confidence adjustments for extreme values
   - Minimum quality thresholds for training data

3. Error Recovery
   - Graceful handling of database errors
   - Fallback values for calculation errors
   - Conservative predictions on failure

### Integration Points
1. Database Integration
   - Type-safe Prisma client usage
   - Proper error handling for database operations
   - Transaction support for related operations

2. Weather Data Processing
   - Sanitization of input data
   - Normalization of weather metrics
   - Handling of missing or invalid metrics

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining metric calculations:
   - Precision calculation
   - Recall calculation
   - F1 score calculation

2. Add integration tests for:
   - Treatment scheduling integration
   - Alert generation with confidence scoring
   - Weather data persistence
   - ML feedback loop validation

3. Enhance error handling:
   - Add specific error types
   - Improve error recovery strategies
   - Add error logging and monitoring

4. Performance optimizations:
   - Caching of model predictions
   - Batch processing for training data
   - Optimized data queries

## Technical Decisions

1. Mock Implementation
   - Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Implemented relationship handling in mocks
   - Added proper error simulation

2. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for core ML functions
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - Edge case coverage for data validation

3. Error Handling
   - Conservative fallbacks for errors
   - Graceful degradation of service
   - Maintained minimum confidence thresholds

## Dependencies
- Prisma Client
- Jest for testing
- jest-mock-extended for mocking
