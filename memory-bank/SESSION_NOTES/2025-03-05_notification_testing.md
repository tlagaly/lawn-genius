## Progress Made
1. Created test user with default notification preferences:
   - Email notifications: enabled
   - Push notifications: disabled
   - Notify frequency: daily
   - Monitored conditions: []
   - Alert thresholds: {}

2. Fixed NextAuth setup:

## Current Status

- Push notifications require web-push package and VAPID keys

## Next Steps
1. Test email notifications:
   - Set up Resend API key in environment
   - Create test weather alert
   - Send test notification
   - Verify delivery

2. Test push notifications:
   - Install web-push package
   - Generate VAPID keys
   - Implement service worker
   - Enable push notifications in UI
   - Verify subscription
   - Send test push notification

3. Test notification history:
   - Create test notifications
   - Verify they appear in history
   - Test mark as read functionality

## Technical Notes

- Push notifications will use web-push package (not yet implemented)
- Notification history is tracked in the database
- Email template includes severity indicators and suggested reschedule dates
- Push notifications will include icons and deep links to alerts
