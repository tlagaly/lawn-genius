# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Auth system implementation: 90% complete
- Auth testing implementation: 75% complete
- Weather integration: 100% complete
- Lawn profile management: 100% complete
- Schedule management: 100% complete
- Notification system: 100% complete

## Recent Achievements
1. Completed weather ML integration and testing
2. Implemented comprehensive auth testing infrastructure
3. Added transaction support to test utilities
4. Improved test database management
5. Fixed session handling in protected routes

## Current Focus
- Completing end-to-end auth flow testing
- Resolving test failures in OAuth and protected routes
- Improving test infrastructure stability

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining auth test failures:
   - OAuth error handling
   - Protected routes unique constraints
   - Session state management

2. Implement additional test coverage:
   - Password reset flow
   - Email verification
   - Account linking/unlinking
   - Session expiration
   - Rate limiting
   - Error boundaries

3. Add E2E testing:
   - Set up Playwright
   - Create E2E test suite
   - Add visual regression testing

4. Infrastructure improvements:
   - Add test data factories
   - Improve mock implementations
   - Add integration test suite

## Blockers
