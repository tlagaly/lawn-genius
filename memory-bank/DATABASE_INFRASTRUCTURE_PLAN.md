# Database Infrastructure Plan

## Requirements Analysis

### Database Type
- PostgreSQL (based on existing Prisma configuration)
- Need connection pooling support
- SSL required for production

### Environment Requirements
1. Staging:
   - Pool Size: 2-15 connections
   - SSL enabled
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Moderate performance needs

2. Production:
   - Pool Size: 5-20 connections
   - Strict SSL configuration
   - High availability
   - Automated backups
   - Performance optimizations

## Provider Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Neon
1. Advantages:
   - Serverless PostgreSQL
   - Built-in connection pooling
   - Automatic scaling
   - Branch feature for staging/development
   - Free tier available
   - Vercel integration

2. Features Alignment:
   - SSL support
   - Connection pooling
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Automated backups
   - Dashboard monitoring

### Alternative: Supabase
1. Advantages:
   - PostgreSQL with additional features
   - Built-in authentication
   - Real-time capabilities
   - Free tier available
   - Good developer experience

2. Considerations:
   - More features than needed
   - Might be overkill for current requirements

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Create Neon account
2. Set up project
3. Create separate branches for:
   - staging
   - production

### 2. Database Configuration
1. Configure connection pools:
   ```sql
   -- Staging
   ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = '15';
   
   -- Production
   ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = '20';
   ```

2. Enable SSL:
   - Use verify-full mode
   - Configure CA certificates

### 3. Environment Setup
1. Generate connection strings for:
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment

2. Configure Prisma:
   - Update schema.prisma
   - Set up migrations
   - Configure connection pooling

### 4. Monitoring Setup
1. Enable database metrics
2. Set up alerts for:
   - Connection pool exhaustion
   - High query latency
   - Storage capacity
   - Error rates

### 5. Backup Strategy
1. Configure automated backups:
   - Daily backups for staging
   - Hourly backups for production
2. Set up point-in-time recovery
3. Document restore procedures

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control
- Separate credentials per environment
- IP allowlisting
- Role-based access control

### 2. Data Protection
- SSL/TLS encryption
- At-rest encryption
- Regular security audits

### 3. Monitoring
- Query performance monitoring
- Security event logging
- Access logging

## Cost Estimation

### Staging Environment
- Compute: Serverless
- Storage: ~10GB
- Estimated cost: $0-50/month

### Production Environment
- Compute: Serverless
- Storage: ~20GB initially
- Estimated cost: $50-150/month

## Next Steps

1. Create Neon account and project
2. Set up staging environment:
   - Create staging branch
   - Configure connection pooling
   - Enable monitoring

3. Set up production environment:
   - Configure high availability
   - Set up automated backups
   - Enable advanced monitoring

4. Update application configuration:
   - Add connection strings to Vercel
   - Update Prisma configuration
   - Test connections
