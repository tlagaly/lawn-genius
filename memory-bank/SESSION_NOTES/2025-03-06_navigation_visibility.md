# Navigation Visibility Improvements

## Overview
Updated the navigation visibility behavior to provide a better user experience by showing the main navigation and footer on marketing pages even when logged in, while keeping them hidden in the dashboard.

## Changes Made
- Modified MainNav component to only hide when in dashboard routes
- Modified Footer component to only hide when in dashboard routes
- Both components now check for:
  1. Authentication status
  2. Current route (dashboard vs marketing)

## Implementation Details
- Used `usePathname` hook to check if current route starts with '/dashboard'
- Components only hide if both conditions are met:
  1. User is authenticated
  2. Current path is a dashboard route

## Testing Results
- Marketing site navigation and footer visible when:
  - Not logged in
  - Logged in but on marketing pages
- Marketing site navigation and footer hidden when:
  - Logged in and on dashboard pages
- Dashboard navigation working as expected
- Smooth transitions between marketing and dashboard sections

## Benefits
- Better user experience with clear context switching
- Marketing site remains fully navigable even when logged in
- Clean dashboard interface without redundant navigation
- Clear separation between marketing and app interfaces

## Notes
- Navigation behavior now aligns with common SaaS patterns
- Users can easily switch between marketing and app contexts
- Improved overall UX with consistent navigation patterns
