# Grass Species Authentication and Image Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed server-side authentication by implementing proper layout component
- Created and tested login page functionality
- Successfully implemented test user seeding
- Verified authentication flow redirects and session handling
- Confirmed grass species data is being fetched correctly

## Current Issues Identified
1. Tooltip Error
   - Need to wrap components in TooltipProvider
   - Error occurs in grass species page components

2. Image Loading
   - Missing grass species images in public directory
   - Need to implement proper image paths and fallbacks
   - Image optimization configuration needs review

## Next Steps
1. Add TooltipProvider to layout or providers
2. Set up proper image directory structure
3. Implement image optimization and loading states
4. Test image display and fallbacks

## Technical Notes
- Authentication using NextAuth.js is working correctly
- TRPC integration for grass species data is functional
- Server-side session handling is properly implemented
- Image paths are configured but content is missing

## Dependencies

- Prisma for database operations

## Suggested Next Task Prompt
"Let's continue implementing the grass species page by:
1. Adding TooltipProvider to fix the tooltip error
2. Setting up the grass species images
3. Implementing proper image optimization
4. Testing the complete flow with authentication and images"
