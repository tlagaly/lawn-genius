# Weather System Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the weather notification system with additional metrics, improved alert batching, and more sophisticated monitoring capabilities.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Additional Weather Metrics
- UV index monitoring for sun exposure
- Soil moisture tracking
- Dew point monitoring for disease risk
- Visibility conditions
- Enhanced temperature and precipitation tracking

### 2. Alert Batching System
- Priority-based alert grouping (1-5 scale)
- Configurable batch windows (5-60 minutes)
- Smart batch processing based on alert urgency
- Treatment-specific alert correlation
- Batch size limits (1-20 alerts)

### 3. Weather Scoring System
- Weighted metric scoring:
  * Temperature: 25%
  * Wind: 20%
  * Precipitation: 20%
  * Soil Moisture: 15%
  * UV Index: 10%
  * Dew Point: 10%
- Treatment-specific thresholds
- Normalized 1-5 scoring scale
- Optimal condition targeting

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring
- Continuous weather tracking
- Configurable check intervals (15-360 minutes)
- Forecast-based predictions (24-168 hours)
- Real-time condition updates

### 5. Error Recovery
- Graceful API failure handling
- Batch processing error recovery
- Monitoring state maintenance
- Alert delivery confirmation

## Technical Details

### Weather Score Calculation
```typescript
// Weight factors
const weights = {
  temperature: 0.25,
  wind: 0.2,
  precipitation: 0.2,
  uvIndex: 0.1,
  soilMoisture: 0.15,
  dewPoint: 0.1
};

// Score normalization
weightedScore * 4 + 1 // Converts 0-1 range to 1-5 scale
```

### Alert Batching Logic
- Batch window: Default 15 minutes
- Max alerts per batch: Default 10
- Minimum alert priority: Default 2
- Priority levels: 1 (low) to 5 (critical)

### Treatment Conditions
Each treatment type has specific thresholds for:
- Temperature range
- Maximum wind speed
- Maximum precipitation
- UV index range
- Soil moisture range
- Dew point thresholds

## Integration Points
- WeatherService singleton instance
- Alert batching system
- Treatment scheduling optimization
- Weather monitoring system
- Notification delivery system

## Next Steps
1. Implement machine learning for treatment optimization
2. Expand test coverage for new metrics
3. Add historical weather analysis
4. Enhance prediction accuracy
5. Implement weather pattern recognition
