# Database Configuration Implementation (2025-03-08)

## Overview
Implemented Phase 2 of the deployment environment plan, focusing on database configuration and environment-specific setups.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Prisma Configuration
- Enhanced schema.prisma with:
  - Connection pooling support
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Edge runtime compatibility
  - Proper relation mode handling

### 2. Database Client
- Created src/lib/db/client.ts:
  - Singleton Prisma client instance
  - Environment-aware configuration
  - Connection management utilities
  - Proper cleanup handlers

### 3. Configuration Management
- Created src/lib/db/config.ts:
  - Type-safe configuration loading
  - Environment-specific validations
  - Connection pool management
  - SSL configuration handling

### 4. Environment Files
Created environment-specific configurations:
- .env.development:
  - Local development settings
  - Minimal pool size (2-10)
  - SSL disabled
  - Debug logging enabled

- .env.staging:
  - Staging environment settings
  - Medium pool size (2-15)
  - SSL enabled
  - Enhanced monitoring

- .env.production:
  - Production environment settings
  - Large pool size (5-20)
  - Strict SSL configuration
  - Performance optimizations

## Technical Decisions

### Connection Pooling
- Development: 2-10 connections
- Staging: 2-15 connections
- Production: 5-20 connections

Rationale:
- Smaller pools for development to conserve resources
- Larger pools for production to handle load
- Balanced timeout settings for connection management

### SSL Configuration
- Development: Disabled for ease of local development
- Staging/Production: Enabled with strict verification
- Added proper certificate handling

### Environment Separation
- Clear separation of concerns between environments
- Environment-specific security settings
- Tailored performance configurations
- Feature flag management

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Implement database backup strategy
2. Set up automated migrations
3. Configure monitoring and alerts

### Future Considerations
1. Connection pool metrics collection
2. Advanced query optimization
3. Replication setup for production
