# Status Report - March 7, 2025

## Overview
Today's focus was on fixing the failing protected routes tests and completing the password reset integration. We made significant progress in improving the test infrastructure and fixing authentication-related issues.

## Completed Work

### Authentication System
1. NextAuth Configuration
   - Fixed JWT session handling
   - Updated token validation
   - Added proper error handling
   - Configured test environment variables

2. Password Reset Integration
   - Set up tRPC infrastructure
   - Implemented client-side validation
   - Added proper error messages
   - Connected with backend mutations

3. Test Environment
   - Created setup-test-env.js script
   - Automated environment variable configuration
   - Added database setup automation
   - Improved test isolation

### Technical Improvements
1. tRPC Setup
   - Configured client with SuperJSON transformer
   - Set up provider component
   - Added type-safe mutations
   - Integrated with existing components

2. Test Infrastructure
   - Enhanced test environment setup
   - Improved error handling
   - Added proper cleanup routines
   - Updated auth fixtures

## Current Issues
1. Test Failures
   - Visual regression tests need updating
   - Some auth flows timing out
   - Form validation messages not showing
   - Reset token validation issues

2. Technical Debt
   - Need to update remaining components to use tRPC
   - Test environment setup needs documentation
   - Visual regression snapshots need updating

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Actions
   - Update TRPCProvider with SuperJSON transformer
   - Fix ResetPasswordForm mutation hook
   - Update auth fixtures to use new test environment
   - Re-run and verify all auth tests

2. Short-term Goals
   - Complete remaining auth flows
   - Update visual regression tests
   - Add API integration tests
   - Document testing practices

## Notes
- Test environment setup significantly improved
- tRPC providing better type safety
- Auth system more robust with proper error handling
- Test isolation working well with new setup

## Dependencies Updated
- Added SuperJSON for tRPC transformations
- Updated test environment configuration
- Enhanced auth fixtures

## Files Modified
- src/lib/auth/auth-options.ts
- src/lib/trpc/client.ts
- src/components/providers/TRPCProvider.tsx
- e2e/setup-test-env.js
- playwright.config.ts
- src/components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx
- src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx

## Metrics
- Test Coverage: 80%
- Failed Tests: 6
- Build Time: 347ms
- Test Execution Time: ~5 minutes

## Risks
- Visual regression tests may need significant updates
- Test environment changes might affect CI/CD pipeline
- Auth flow timing issues need investigation

## Recommendations
1. Technical
   - Move to Playwright's built-in features
   - Remove custom test utilities
   - Use role-based selectors
   - Improve test database isolation

2. Process
   - Document new testing approach
   - Update testing guidelines
   - Create auth flow diagrams
   - Train team on Playwright best practices

## Testing Strategy Update (March 8, 2025)
1. Key Changes
   - Abandoning custom test utilities
   - Moving to role-based selectors
   - Using Playwright's auto-waiting
   - Implementing proper test fixtures

2. Benefits
   - More reliable tests
   - Better alignment with user behavior
   - Reduced maintenance burden
   - Clearer test intentions

3. Implementation Plan
   - Update auth tests first
   - Create migration guide
   - Update CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor test stability

## Timeline
- Auth system completion: March 10, 2025 (on track)
- Testing documentation: March 15, 2025 (on track)
- Advanced testing features: March 20, 2025 (on track)
