   - Unique constraints ✓
   - Concurrent sessions ✓

3. Password Reset Flow
   - Token generation and validation ✓
   - Email sending mocks ✓
   - Error scenarios ✓
   - Integration tests ✓
   - Factory pattern implementation ✓
   - E2E test coverage ✓
   - Visual regression tests ✓

4. E2E Testing
   - Playwright configuration ✓
   - Auth fixtures and utilities ✓
   - Initial auth flow tests ✓
   - Test utilities implemented ✓
   - Visual regression tests implemented ✓
   Next:
   - Implement cross-browser testing
   - Add performance testing
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Context
- Using Jest for unit and integration testing
- Prisma transactions for test data management
- NextAuth for authentication
- Custom test utilities for database management
- Email service mocking for tests
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Visual regression testing with Playwright

## Recent Changes
1. Password Reset Implementation
   - Added password reset service with token management
   - Implemented email notification system
   - Added comprehensive test coverage
   - Created tRPC endpoints for reset flow
   - Added validation and error handling
   - Added visual regression tests

2. Test Infrastructure
   - Enhanced test factory pattern
   - Added transaction support
   - Improved error simulation
   - Added email service mocks
   - Implemented combined auth fixtures
   - Added visual regression testing

## Next Actions
1. Testing Infrastructure Complete ✓
   - Cross-browser testing configured ✓
   - Mobile viewport testing added ✓
   - Performance metrics and baselines established ✓
   - CI/CD pipeline configured ✓

2. Next Steps
   - Monitor initial CI runs
   - Fine-tune performance thresholds
   - Add accessibility testing
   - Expand test coverage

## Testing Infrastructure
1. Cross-browser Testing
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari configured
   - Mobile devices: Pixel 5, iPhone 13
   - Viewport consistency enforced

2. Performance Testing
   - Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Custom performance metrics
   - Automated threshold checks

3. CI/CD Pipeline
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Browser matrix testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Coverage reporting (80% threshold)

## Dependencies
- Next.js 15.2.1
- Prisma 6.4.1
- NextAuth 4.24.11
- Jest 29.7.0
- Nodemailer 6.9.12
- Playwright 1.51.0

## Notes
- Consider adding performance testing
- Look into automated accessibility testing
- Plan for cross-browser testing strategy
- Consider implementing test coverage reports
