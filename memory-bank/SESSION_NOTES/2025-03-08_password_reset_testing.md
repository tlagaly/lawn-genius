# Password Reset Testing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure for the password reset functionality, including fixtures and E2E tests.

## Components Created

### 1. Password Reset Fixture (e2e/fixtures/password-reset.fixture.ts)
- Token generation and validation helpers
- Rate limiting simulation
- Account lockout simulation
- Test cleanup utilities

### 2. Combined Auth Fixture (e2e/fixtures/combined-auth.fixture.ts)
- Integrated password reset fixtures
- Prepared for future auth testing extensions

### 3. Password Reset Tests (e2e/tests/auth/password-reset.spec.ts)
Implemented test cases for:
- Token generation and validation
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Account lockout behavior
- Password validation rules
- Security timing consistency
- Success scenarios
- Error handling

## Security Considerations Tested
- Rate limiting (3 requests per hour)
- Account lockout (5 failed attempts)
- Timing attack prevention
- User enumeration prevention
- Password complexity requirements

## Next Steps
1. Run the test suite in CI environment
2. Monitor for any flaky tests
3. Consider adding visual regression tests
4. Expand coverage to edge cases

## Notes
- Used test factory pattern for consistent test data
- Implemented proper cleanup between tests
- Added artificial timing checks for security
- Maintained isolation between test cases
