# Grass Species Image Implementation Progress

## Work Completed
1. Updated Prisma schema with image fields:
   - mainImage (primary species image)
   - images (additional images array)
   - imageDescriptions (metadata for images)

2. Updated seed data structure:
   - Added image fields to GrassSpeciesInput type
   - Added placeholder image paths for all species
   - Created directory structure for species images

3. Modified TRPC implementation:
   - Updated grassSpeciesSchema with image fields
   - Modified getAll query to include image fields
   - Switched from ctx.db to ctx.prisma for consistency

4. Updated UI components:
   - Added image display to SpeciesCard
   - Implemented image gallery in details modal
   - Added fallback handling for missing images

## Current Blockers
1. React Context error in grass species page
   - Need to properly handle client/server component separation
   - Authentication needs to be restructured

## Next Steps
1. Fix server component issue:
   - Move authentication to layout or client wrapper
   - Ensure proper data fetching pattern
2. Add actual species images:
   - Source high-quality images for each species
   - Create proper image optimization pipeline
3. Implement image upload functionality:
   - Add admin interface for image management
   - Set up secure image storage
