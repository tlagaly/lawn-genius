# Auth Testing Learnings - March 8, 2025

## Attempted Approaches That Failed

1. Custom Wait Functions
   - `waitForHydration`: Tried to detect Next.js hydration completion
   - `waitForFormReady`: Custom form readiness detection
   - Issue: Unreliable and led to timeouts
   - Lesson: Custom wait functions add complexity without improving reliability

2. Data-testid Based Selectors
   - Used `data-testid` attributes for form elements
   - Issue: Brittle and disconnected from user experience
   - Lesson: Test IDs don't reflect how users interact with the app

3. Custom Form Interaction Utils
   - Created enhanced form field handling
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Issue: Over-engineered solution that didn't improve stability
   - Lesson: Complex retry mechanisms often mask underlying issues

4. Session State Detection
   - Tried to verify session establishment
   - Added polling for session state
   - Issue: Race conditions and timing issues
   - Lesson: Session verification should be handled at the API level

## Current Issues

1. Form Hydration
   - Forms are disabled until hydration completes
   - No reliable way to detect hydration state
   - Tests timeout waiting for elements to be interactive

2. Navigation Guard
   - Protected routes not consistently redirecting
   - Race condition between auth check and navigation
   - Test expects /auth/login but stays at /dashboard

3. Label Mismatches
   - Tests using incorrect label text
   - Example: "Email" vs "Email address"
   - Shows importance of testing from user perspective

## Recommendations

1. Simplify Testing Approach
   - Use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
   - Rely on role-based selectors (getByRole, getByLabel)
   - Test from user perspective

2. Improve App Architecture
   - Consider server-side form validation
   - Implement proper route protection at middleware level
   - Reduce reliance on client-side hydration

3. Test Infrastructure
   - Need better test database isolation
   - Consider mocking auth state
   - Add proper test environment setup

## Next Steps

1. Review middleware implementation for route protection
2. Evaluate form handling architecture
3. Consider removing client-side hydration checks
4. Implement proper test database seeding
