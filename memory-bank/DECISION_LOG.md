# Technical Decision Log

## Version Control Strategy (2025-03-07)

### Context
Need to establish consistent version control practices and workflows for the project to ensure code quality, maintainability, and efficient collaboration.

### Decisions

1. Branch Strategy
   - **Decision**: Implement GitFlow-based branching strategy
   - **Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns and supports multiple concurrent development streams
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Trunk-based development (rejected due to need for release management)
     * GitHub Flow (rejected due to need for more structured release process)
   - **Impact**: Better release management and parallel development capabilities

2. Commit Standards
   - **Decision**: Adopt Conventional Commits specification
   - **Rationale**: Enables automated changelog generation and clear commit history
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Free-form commits with templates
     * Custom commit format
   - **Impact**: Improved repository maintainability and automation capabilities

3. Quality Gates
   - **Decision**: Implement comprehensive pre-commit hooks and CI/CD checks
   - **Rationale**: Ensures code quality and consistency
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Manual code review only
     * Post-merge quality checks
   - **Impact**: Higher code quality and reduced review burden

### Implementation Notes
- Created VERSION_CONTROL.md with comprehensive guidelines
- Will implement Git hooks and CI/CD pipelines
- Need to configure branch protection rules

### Status
- Implementation: Pending
- Review: Completed
- Documentation: Completed

## Auth Testing Infrastructure (2025-03-07)

### Context
Need to implement comprehensive testing for auth flows while ensuring test isolation and stability.

### Decisions

1. Test Database Management
   - **Decision**: Create dedicated test database setup script
   - **Rationale**: Ensures clean test environment and proper permissions
   - **Alternatives Considered**: 
     * Using in-memory database (rejected due to Prisma limitations)
     * Using mocked database (rejected for integration testing needs)
   - **Impact**: Improved test reliability and isolation

2. Transaction Support
   - **Decision**: Use Prisma transactions for test operations
   - **Rationale**: Ensures atomic operations and proper cleanup
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Manual cleanup after each test
     * Global cleanup hooks
   - **Impact**: Better data consistency and test isolation

3. Test Utilities
   - **Decision**: Implement enhanced test utilities with force cleanup
   - **Rationale**: Provides better control over test state
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Using beforeEach/afterEach hooks only
     * Database truncation between tests
   - **Impact**: More reliable test execution and cleanup

4. Wait Times
   - **Decision**: Add configurable wait times between operations
   - **Rationale**: Prevents race conditions in database operations
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Polling for state changes
     * Event-based synchronization
   - **Impact**: Improved stability at cost of slightly longer test runs

5. Error Handling
   - **Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling in test utilities
   - **Rationale**: Better debugging and test failure analysis
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     * Minimal error handling
     * Global error handler
   - **Impact**: Easier troubleshooting and maintenance

### Implementation Notes

1. Database Setup
   ```typescript
   // Using transactions for atomic operations
   await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
     // Operations here
   });
   ```

2. Test Utilities
   ```typescript
   // Force cleanup with wait times
   export const forceCleanup = async () => {
     await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
       // Cleanup operations
     });
     await waitForDb();
   };
   ```

3. Error Handling
   ```typescript
   try {
     await operation();
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Operation failed:', error);
     throw error;
   }
   ```

### Future Considerations

1. Test Data Factories
   - Need to implement factory patterns for test data
   - Consider using Faker.js for data generation

2. Visual Testing
   - Plan to add visual regression testing
   - Consider Percy or similar tools

3. Performance Testing
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Monitor test execution times

4. E2E Testing
   - Plan to implement with Playwright
   - Need to consider CI/CD integration

### Consequences

#### Positive
- More reliable test execution
- Better test isolation
- Easier debugging
- Improved maintainability

#### Negative
- Slightly longer test execution time
- More complex setup
- Learning curve for new developers

### Status
- Implementation: In Progress
- Review: Pending
- Documentation: In Progress
