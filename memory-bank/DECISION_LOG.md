## 2025-03-05: Recurring Schedules Implementation

### Context
The lawn care management system needs to support recurring schedules for treatments while maintaining weather optimization features.

### Decision
Implement recurring schedules using a separate RecurrencePattern model with support for:
- Multiple frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Exception handling
- Weather-based optimization
- Parent-child schedule relationships

### Alternatives Considered
1. Embedding recurrence rules in Schedule model
   - Pros: Simpler data model
   - Cons: Less flexible, harder to modify patterns
   
2. Using a calendar library's recurrence rules
   - Pros: Proven implementation
   - Cons: Less control over weather integration

3. Generating all occurrences upfront
   - Pros: Simpler querying
   - Cons: Storage intensive, less adaptable

### Consequences
Positive:
- Flexible recurrence patterns
- Strong exception handling
- Weather optimization per occurrence
- Clear separation of concerns

Negative:
- More complex data model
- Additional database queries
- Need for occurrence calculation logic

### Implementation Plan
1. Database schema updates
2. Core recurrence logic
3. Weather integration
4. UI components
5. Testing and validation

### Metrics
- Performance impact on schedule queries
- Weather optimization effectiveness
- User engagement with recurring schedules
