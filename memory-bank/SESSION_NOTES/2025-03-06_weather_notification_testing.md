# Weather Notification System Testing Progress

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- Jest and React Testing Library setup
- Basic test configuration (jest.config.mjs, jest.setup.js)
- Initial test files structure
- Weather service configuration and types
- Basic test cases for core functionality

### Test Files Created
- src/components/weather/__tests__/WeatherAlert.test.tsx
- src/components/weather/__tests__/WeatherAlertList.test.tsx
- src/lib/notifications/__tests__/weather-notification-integration.test.ts
- src/lib/weather/__tests__/weather-monitor-config.test.ts

### Test Coverage Areas
- Weather alert rendering
- User preference handling
- Notification delivery
- Alert generation
- Configuration validation

## Current Challenges

### Type System
- Type mismatches between WeatherService and tRPC routers
- Return type consistency issues
- Need to align service method signatures with actual usage

### Integration Points
- Mock data generation needs
- Test isolation requirements
- Database integration approach

## Next Development Session

### Priority Tasks
1. Resolve type errors in WeatherService class
2. Implement remaining test cases:
   - Weather condition monitoring
   - Treatment scheduling optimization
   - Alert batching and frequency handling
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Database integration

### Environment Setup Needed
- Mock weather API responses
- Test database configuration
- Email service mocks
- Push notification service mocks

### Testing Infrastructure
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance and load testing
- Test documentation
- CI/CD test workflow

## Resume Development With

```typescript
// Example prompt for next session:
<task>
Continue implementing the weather notification system tests:

1. Fix type errors in WeatherService class:
   - Align method signatures with tRPC router usage
   - Update return types for analyzeTreatmentEffectiveness
   - Ensure consistent types across the application

2. Implement next set of test cases:
   - Weather condition monitoring
   - Treatment scheduling optimization
   - Alert batching
   - Error recovery

3. Set up test environment:
   - Configure mock weather API
   - Set up test database
   - Implement service mocks

Focus on maintaining test isolation and proper error handling throughout.
</task>
```

## Notes
- Keep test cases focused and isolated
- Ensure proper mocking of external services
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Document any assumptions or limitations
