# Vercel Deployment Setup Session (2025-03-08)

## Overview
Attempted to set up Vercel deployment and configure lawnsync.ai domain. Encountered several issues with build configuration and environment setup.

## Work Completed

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - DATABASE_URL for both production and preview
  - NEXTAUTH_URL for both environments
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET
  - Database configuration variables
  - NODE_ENV and rate limiting settings

### 2. Vercel Configuration
- Created vercel.json with deployment settings:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "buildCommand": "npx prisma generate && npm run build",
    "devCommand": "npm run dev",
    "installCommand": "npm install",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "git": {
      "deploymentEnabled": {
        "main": true,
        "staging": true
      }
    },
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production",
      "DATABASE_RELATION_MODE": "prisma",
      "DATABASE_SSL_ENABLED": "true",
      "DATABASE_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "true",
      "DATABASE_POOL_MIN": "2",
      "DATABASE_POOL_MAX": "20",
      "DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT": "30000",
      "DATABASE_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT": "60000"
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Issues Encountered
1. Build command mismatch:
   - Initial attempts used incorrect script names
   - Fixed by using direct npx commands
2. Environment variable configuration:
   - Set up database URLs for both environments
   - Configured NextAuth settings
3. Branch deployment issues:
   - Deployment attempting to use develop branch instead of main

## Next Steps
Created DEPLOYMENT_RETRY_PLAN.md outlining comprehensive steps for:
1. Cleaning up current Vercel configuration
2. Setting up repository correctly
3. Creating fresh deployment
4. Configuring environments and domains

## Notes
- All configuration changes have been committed to the repository
- Next attempt should follow the retry plan for a clean setup
- Consider implementing automated deployment verification
