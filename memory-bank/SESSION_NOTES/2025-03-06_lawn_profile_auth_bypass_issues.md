# Lawn Profile Auth Bypass Issues

## Work Done
1. Updated middleware to handle development auth bypass
2. Modified TRPC client port configuration
3. Added headers to TRPC provider
4. Attempted to fix auth bypass for lawn profile creation

## Issues Encountered
1. Initial 500 error on page load
2. Redirect loop with auth middleware
3. TRPC authentication issues persisting

## Changes Made
1. Updated middleware.ts to:
   - Only protect dashboard routes
   - Handle development test account properly
   - Update matcher configuration

2. Updated TRPC configuration:
   - Fixed client port in getBaseUrl
   - Added headers to httpBatchLink
   - Modified auth bypass handling

## Next Steps
1. Debug TRPC authentication flow:
   - Check server-side session handling
   - Verify TRPC context creation
   - Review protected procedure implementation
2. Consider implementing logging for auth flow
3. Test alternative auth bypass approaches

## Technical Notes
- Current approach using middleware + TRPC protected procedures may be causing conflicts
- Need to ensure consistent session handling between Next.js auth and TRPC
- Consider separating development auth bypass logic from production auth flow
