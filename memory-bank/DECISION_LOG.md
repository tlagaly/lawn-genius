# Decision Log

## Visual Regression Testing Implementation (2025-03-07)

### Context
Need to ensure consistent visual appearance of auth flows and detect unintended UI changes.

### Decisions

1. Visual Regression Strategy
   - **Decision**: Use Playwright's built-in screenshot comparison
   - **Rationale**: 
     - Native integration with our E2E testing framework
     - Automatic handling of different viewport sizes
     - Built-in diffing capabilities
     - CI/CD friendly

2. Screenshot Coverage
   - **Decision**: Capture key auth flow states
   - **Rationale**:
     - Critical user journey documentation
     - Regression detection for important states
     - Balance between coverage and maintenance

3. Test Organization
   - **Decision**: Combine auth fixtures for comprehensive testing
   - **Rationale**:
     - Reduced code duplication
     - Easier test maintenance
     - Better test isolation
     - Clearer test organization

### Implementation Notes

1. Screenshot Strategy
   - Capture after important state changes
   - Include error states
   - Include success states
   - Include form validation states

2. Test Structure
   - Combined auth fixtures for better organization
   - Reusable test utilities
   - Clear test naming conventions
   - Isolated test environments

## Password Reset Implementation (2025-03-07)

### Context
Need to implement a secure password reset flow with comprehensive test coverage.

### Decisions

1. Token Generation and Storage
   - **Decision**: Use crypto.randomBytes for token generation and bcrypt for hashing
   - **Rationale**: 
     - Cryptographically secure random tokens
     - Hashed storage prevents token exposure
     - Consistent with existing password hashing approach

2. Token Expiry
   - **Decision**: 24-hour expiration window
   - **Rationale**:
     - Balances security with user convenience
     - Industry standard timeframe
     - Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

3. Email Service Architecture
   - **Decision**: Separate email service module with environment-based configuration
   - **Rationale**:
     - Easy to mock in tests
     - Configurable for different environments
     - Clean separation of concerns

4. Test Strategy
   - **Decision**: Implement factory pattern for test data
   - **Rationale**:
     - Consistent test data generation
     - Easier test maintenance
     - Reusable across test suites

5. Error Handling
   - **Decision**: Use tRPC error handling with specific error codes
   - **Rationale**:
     - Consistent error format
     - Type-safe error handling
     - Clear error messages for frontend

6. Security Considerations
   - **Decision**: Don't reveal user existence in reset flow
   - **Rationale**:
     - Prevents user enumeration
     - Consistent response timing
     - Enhanced privacy protection

### Implementation Notes

1. Testing Infrastructure
   - Implemented comprehensive mocking strategy
   - Added transaction support for test isolation
   - Created reusable test utilities

2. Security Measures
   - Token hashing before storage
   - Automatic token expiration
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Secure email templates

3. Future Considerations
   - Monitor token usage patterns
   - Consider implementing rate limiting
   - Add analytics for security monitoring
   - Consider adding account lockout after failed attempts

### Impact
- Enhanced security through proper token management
- Improved test coverage and maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns in implementation
- Type-safe API endpoints
- Comprehensive visual regression testing
